		<h1>Dumplings</h1>
		<p>Dumplings are probably the best meal to ever exist. When
			I would get these in school, I would jump with joy. My
			family would always make these for thanksgiving too.
			The love for dumplings just runs in the family.</p>
		<blockquote>"The more I make this, the more I love this!
			This is the best thing that has ever existed!"<br>- My Mom</blockquote>

		<h1>Directions:</h1>
		<ol>
			<li>Whisk together the ingredients for the dipping sauce, 
				making sure the sugar dissolves. Set aside.</li>
			<li>Add the scallions, garlic, ginger, hoisin, soy sauce and 
				sesame oil to a small food processor. Pulse until finely
				chopped. Transfer the mixture to a large bowl.</li>
			<li>Add the beaten egg and mix to combine.</li>
			<li>Add the pork and mix to combine</li>
			<li>Place about 1 tablespoon of filling in the center of a
				wrapper. Dip your finger in the water and use it to
				moisten the edge of the wrapper.</li>
			<li>Pinch one end tightly to seal and then make several 
				pleats to close up the filling entirely. Flatten out the 
				bottom. If not pleating, simply fold one half of the 
				wrapper over the filling and press together to seal.</li>
			<li>Set the dumpling on the prepared baking sheet and cover 
				with a damp towel while you continue filling the rest.</li>
			<li>Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add 1 cup 
				of water to the pan, then place 6-7 dumplings in the 
				water. Cover with a clear lid and let steam for 10 
				minutes, without lifting the lid.</li>
			<li>Continue with the remaining dumplings. Serve the dumplings 
				with the dipping sauce.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>You can freeze any uncooked dumplings and cook them later 
			using the same method, but steaming for an additional 
			1â€“2 minutes longer.</p>
		<p>Now you can eat!</p>
		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>You can eat these with chopsticks or a fork!</li>
			<li>You don't have to dip it in soy sauce, but it will 
				taste better!</li>
