Goal:
Make side-sites to index.html (chris my sites are about.html, gallery.html, and contact.html)
Get the contact page to work

Getting the contact page to work was past my abilities, as I don't know how to use PHP

Finished everything else
All of the communication was over text, everything was shown.
